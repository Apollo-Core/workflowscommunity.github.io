description: Registries, Projects, initiatives and standards relating to FAIR Computational Workflows
---

This is a list of registries, projects, initiatives and standards related to [FAIR Computational Workflows](../).

## Registries

* [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) – a repository and registry of life science workflows
* [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/) – sharing Docker Tools and Workflows for the Sciences
* [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/) – registry of tools in life sciences
* [nf-core](nf-co.re/) – curated [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflows for bioinformatics
* Published Galaxy workflows on [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/workflows/list_published) and [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/workflows/list_published)


## Projects and initiatives

Related projects and initiatives supporting FAIR Computational Workflows aims:

* [WorkflowHub Club](https://about.workflowhub.eu/)
* [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/)
* [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/)
* [BioExcel](https://bioexcel.eu/)
  - [BioExcel Building Blocks](http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/biobb/) (biobb) – software library for interoperable biomolecular simulation workflows
* [WorkflowsRI](https://workflowsri.org/) – Towards an Infrastructure for Enabling Systematic Development and Research of Scientific Workflow Management Systems
* [FAIR Workflows](https://fair-workflows.github.io/project.html) – an NWO/eScience Center project
* [FAIR for Research Software](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg) (FAIR4RS) – working group at Research Data Alliance 
* [UseGalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/) – a European-wide Galaxy workflow platform

_Note that the similarly named project [Implementing FAIR Workflows](https://www.stage.datacite.org/fair-workflows.html) is about making the overall research process FAIR, not necessarily related to computational workflows._

Related standards for FAIR computational workflows:

* [Common Workflow Language](http://commonwl.org/) – Interoperable execution of computational workflows, supported by multiple engines and with strong support for [workflow metadata](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/17-metadata/)
* [RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate) – FAIR packaging of research outputs and metadata, [including workflows](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/workflows.html)
* [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/) – improve findability of FAIR life science resources on the Web, including [computational workflows](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalWorkflow/) and [computational tools](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalTool/)
* [Biocompute Objects](https://www.biocomputeobject.org/) and [IEEE 2791-2020](https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.2020.9094416): standard for describing workflows in regulatory sciences.
