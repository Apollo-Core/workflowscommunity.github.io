As a Software Architect, you will play a significant role in the design of a variety of cutting-edge cloud computing projects that serve as an extension of Covalent, our open-source workflow management tool. In this role, you will be responsible for executing the product's technical specifications and software stack, while ensuring its scalability for future growth. You will work closely with engineering to assist in the planning and implementation of these projects. The ideal candidate is a strategic problem solver and is comfortable in a startup environment. He/she will possess the following hard and soft skills:

1. Ability to see the big picture - the ideal candidate will understand how different pieces of the application stack, including the cloud components, front-end, back-end and databases fit together in a holistic manner.
2. Ability to work across multiple layers of the stack - the ideal candidate will be able to assess & evaluate the software product on both the horizontal (across technology) and vertical (across low level details to high level architecture) levels.
3. Interest in learning and evaluating new technologies - the ideal candidate will be a quick study, keen to assess and recommend new technologies for the application stack.
4. Ability to bridge product and technology - the ideal candidate will be a bridge between product and technology by virtue of their strong communication skills, and their ability to identify and articulate potential risks and impacts on product timelines.
