## Overview

We are currently seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher to work at the intersection of machine learning and high-performance computing(HPC) systems, and develop artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions for DOE scientific user facilities. In particular, the project aims to develop AI/ML models and infrastructure to extract  features in X-ray detector data at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne and Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC. Because such models can run at high speeds, thanks to advances in AI  accelerators, it becomes feasible to extract salient information from in-flight data, in real time, and thus both enabling fast feedback and reducing downstream computational burden.

In this role you will conduct cutting-edge research in data science and deep learning applied to scientific problems in X-ray science, and play a key roles in developing physics-based AI/ML models, developing workflow and implement rapid ML model training on data center AI systems (e.g., ALCF AI Testbed and Argonne's Aurora exascale supercomputer), end-to-end model training workflows and explore AI accelerators for simulation applications.

## Position Requirements

- Recent PhD (typically completed within 0-3 years) in a computer science, physical sciences or engineering or related field.
- Comprehensive experience programming in one or more programming languages, such as Python.
- Experience with machine learning methods and deep learning frameworks, including tensorflow, pytorch.
- Software development practices and techniques for computational and data-intensive science problems.
- Experience in interdisciplinary research involving computer and material scientists.
- Experience with applied machine learning (e.g., successful projects that used ML to resolve scientific problems).
- Experience with high-performance computing and/or scientific workflow.
- Exceptional communication skills, ability to communicate effectively with internal and external collaborators and ability to work in team environment.
- Ability to model Argonneâ€™s Core Values: Impact, Safety, Respect, Integrity, and Teamwork.
