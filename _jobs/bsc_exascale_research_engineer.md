## About BSC

The Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputaci√≥n (BSC-CNS) is the leading supercomputing center in Spain. It houses MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, and is a hosting member of the PRACE European distributed supercomputing infrastructure. The mission of BSC is to research, develop and manage information technologies in order to facilitate scientific progress. BSC combines HPC service provision and R&D into both computer and computational science (life, earth and engineering sciences) under one roof, and currently has over 770 staff from 55 countries.

## Context And Mission

BSC is looking for a research engineer that contributes to the container support and to an ecosystem targeting RISC-V-based ISA for a European HPC accelerator. The position is funded by a project aiming to build the software infrastructure and toolchain for an FPGA-based emulator for an energy-efficient Exascale system.

More specifically, the candidate will collaborate with the Workflows and Distributed Computing (WDC) group to validate container images running PyCOMPSs applications ([compss.bsc.es](compss.bsc.es)). PyCOMPSs is a task-based programming model developed by the WDC group, that aims at easing the development of parallel applications for distributed computing. Between the applications to validate, the candidate will work with machine learning applications (dislib scripts, see [dislib.bsc.es](dislib.bsc.es)) parallelized with COMPSs. In addition, the candidate will support the whole project on its CD/CI infrastructure.

## Key Duties

- Validation of COMPSs container images for RISC-V architecture
- Validation of COMPSs applications on top of containers for RISC-V
- Validate machine learning applications on the RISC-V architecture
- Extend containers and the container ecosystem to RISC-V based hardware.
- Build and maintain high-performance runtime frameworks, libraries, and services

## Requirements

### Education
- Master in Computer Science, or related Engineering degree or equivalent level of professional experience.
